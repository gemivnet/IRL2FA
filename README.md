# IRL2FA - Real-World Two-Factor Authentication Device

A handheld authentication device that helps verify phone conversations with friends and family in an age where AI voice cloning makes phone fraud increasingly common.

## Overview

In today's world of sophisticated AI voice cloning, phone scams targeting the elderly have become increasingly sophisticated. IRL2FA generates synchronized word pairs every 15 seconds - one word for you and one for your trusted contact. During phone calls, exchange these words to verify each other's identity, making it impossible for scammers to impersonate you or your loved ones.

Give one to your grandmother and never worry about her falling victim to scammers pretending to be you on the phone again.

*As a bonus feature, it also works as a standard two-factor authentication token for your online accounts.*
